# A dynamic task offloading algorithm based on greedy matching in vehicle network

The project implemented a dynamic task offloading algorithm for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) based on greedy matching principles. The algorithm can dynamically assign tasks to communication endpoints based on real-time network conditions, task characteristics, and resource availability. This approach aims to optimize task assignment, minimize response times, and enhance service quality for cloud-based applications in vehicular environments. Existing task offloading approaches may not fully address the unique challenges caused by VANETs, necessitating innovative solutions.

## Greedy Matching Algorithm

- Uses a greedy matching approach to assign tasks to available VFSs or RSUs. 
- It is for adapting the dynamics of traffic

## to execute 
`python3 simulate.py`

it will generate the data in the form of json files

RSU.json
vfs.json
user_vehicle.json
distances_rsu.json
distances_vfs.json
vehicles.json

## Algorithms used
1. KMM
2. GMDC
